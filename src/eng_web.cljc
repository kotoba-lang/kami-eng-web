  "Zero-dep portable `.cljc` restored (scoped) from the legacy
  `kami-engine/kami-eng-web` Rust crate (912-line `lib.rs` + Cargo.toml +
  `test-visual.html`, deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 \"Remove
  Rust workspace from kami-engine\") as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, `com-junkawasaki/root`).

  ## What this is

  The original crate was a `wasm-bindgen` entry-point layer: ~40 thin
  `#[wasm_bindgen] pub fn` exports, each parsing/marshaling simple params or
  JSON into a call on one of 17 sibling `kami-*` crates (`kami-eda`,
  `kami-cad`, `kami-cam`, `kami-rtl`, `kami-cae`, `kami-spice`, `kami-pdk`,
  `kami-pnr`, `kami-dft`, `kami-verify`, `kami-power`, `kami-si`,
  `kami-pkg`, `kami-yield`, `kami-ip`, `kami-flow`, plus `kami-eng-core`/
  `kami-eng-io`/`kami-eng-render`, already restored separately as
  `kotoba-lang/{engineer,engineer-io,engineer-render}`) and serializing the
  result to JSON for JS/TS consumption. `test-visual.html` is a plain demo
  page: it loads the compiled wasm module and draws canvas visualizations
  of each function's output — no additional portable logic of its own.

  None of `kami-eng-web`'s ~40 exports contain a *complete* portable
  computation: every one delegates its actual work (schematic ERC,
  B-rep tessellation, G-code toolpath generation, RTL simulation, FEA
  meshing, SPICE MNA solve, PDK tech-file/stdcell/memory compilation,
  floorplanning, GDSII export, scan-insertion/ATPG, equivalence checking,
  power/IR-drop analysis, transmission-line/eye-diagram calc, package/
  thermal estimation, Monte Carlo yield, NoC synthesis, CDC analysis, and
  the P10 signoff flow) to one of those 16 *other*, still-unrestored
  `kami-*` crates. There is no `kami-eng-web`-owned algorithm to restore.

  What *is* portable, and is what this restoration ports, is the small
  amount of pure input-shaping logic that lived directly in `lib.rs`
  itself, ahead of each external-crate call: string -> enum/keyword
  parsing (tech-node names, package types, NoC topologies) and fixed
  default-value struct literals (tool/stock/pocket-op/gcode-config
  defaults, scan-chain config, thermal-spec constants, package presets,
  the die-sizing heuristic, the IR-drop current-map builder, and the
  coverage-report aggregate arithmetic):

  | Namespace | From (fn in original `lib.rs`) | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | `eng-web.tech-node` | `parse_tech_node` | Tech-node name string -> keyword |
  | `eng-web.package` | `pkg_estimate`/`pkg_thermal` | Package-type presets + thermal-spec defaults |
  | `eng-web.noc` | `ip_generate_noc` | NoC topology string -> config + defaults |
  | `eng-web.coverage` | `verify_coverage_report` | Coverage aggregate stats (total/hit -> pct, uncovered) |
  | `eng-web.floorplan` | `pnr_auto_floorplan` | Block-input normalization + die-sizing heuristic |
  | `eng-web.ir-drop` | `power_analyze_ir_drop` | Uniform interior-current grid builder |
  | `eng-web.dft` | `dft_insert_scan`/`dft_generate_atpg` | Scan-chain config + FF-name/fault-list synthesis |
  | `eng-web.cam` | `cam_generate_gcode` | Tool/stock/pocket-op/gcode-config defaults |

  **Excluded entirely** (native-only / delegates to unported crates, no
  portable logic of its own): every `#[wasm_bindgen]` export's actual
  computation (schematic/ERC/gerber, B-rep/tessellation/STEP, toolpath
  generation, Verilog parse/simulate/VCD, FEA meshing/materials, SPICE MNA
  solve, PDK tech-file/stdcell/memory compile, floorplan placement/GDSII
  export, scan-chain insertion/ATPG pattern generation, equivalence
  checking, dynamic-power/IR-drop solve, transmission-line Z0/eye-diagram
  calc, package/thermal estimation math, Monte Carlo yield run/PVT corners,
  NoC router/link synthesis, CDC analysis, the P10 signoff flow), the
  `eng_sdk_version` version-string passthrough, and `test-visual.html`
  (pure browser-canvas demo harness, not source logic).

  ## Status

  Restored (scoped) — see `test/eng_web_test.cljc` for coverage of every
  ported namespace, plus a namespace-loads smoke test. The original had no
  `#[test]`s in `lib.rs`."
